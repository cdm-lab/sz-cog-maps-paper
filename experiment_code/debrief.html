<h3>What are we trying to learn in this research?</h3>
<p>Cognitive control, which involves flexibly directing attention toward stimuli that are relevant to one's goals while ignoring irrelevant information, is believed to govern performance on a variety of tasks including those such as Stroop color-naming, flanker tasks, task switching, and prospective memory. Importantly, the flexible adjustment of attention is believed to be cognitively effortful. When reward is equivalent, people tend to make decisions that limit their amount of effortful cognitive exertion. The purpose of this research was to better understand cognitive control processes and how they affect subsequent decisions about what stimuli are experienced.</p>

<h3>Why is this important to scientists or the general public?</h3>
<p>These questions are of theoretical importance to further our understanding of cognitive control processes and their interactions with memory. They are also important for understanding populations with cognitive control deficits (e.g., Schizophrenia) and tasks requiring cognitive control (e.g., driving). We also hope to expand our understanding of how people choose to exert or avoid exerting mental effort.</p>

<h3>What are our hypothesis and predictions?</h3>
<p>We believe that shifts in the amount of cognitive control will be reflected in stimulus memorability. For the categories where you experienced choices that lead to a larger reward you should have encoded the explicit background image more. In that case recieving a large reward might result in better memory for the preceding steps. We also hypothesize that the novel objects you rated will be more similar to each other after the task if they shared a category. For instance the two objects you experienced in the desert should become more similar to each other relative to your initial ratings. Your internal idea of which of them belong together should be different before and after the task.</p>
